          who leverages 8 years
          of sales and account management experience to build and implement
          consumer driven products. Whether it be navigating B2B sales issues or
          developing websites, I really enjoy diagnosing the core problems to
          technical issues and developing customized solutions that speak to the
          heart of customers needs.
