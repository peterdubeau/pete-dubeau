    "description": "Telemelt is a web-based multi-emulator (RetroArch/libretro) designed to recreate the experience of playing console games with a single controller in a room full of friends. The system skips traditional netplay to allow a single player to assume host responsibility and experience zero network latency for games with demanding response times, with the viewers processing frames as broadcasted by the player. The virtual controller/host can be instantly passed to any user in the room.",
