The admin can then share that code with their friends to easily join the room. When a user completes the task (ie buying a round of drinks at the bar) their name is removed from the pool. Once all users have completed the task, all user names are placed back in the task pool to repeat the process. Wether it be buying rounds of drinks at the bar or completing household chores, Next Round will make sure everybody chips in.",
